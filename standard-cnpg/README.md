# Postgres Docker Image for Tembo's Standard Stack

Contains a `Dockerfile` with trunk, barman-cloud, Postgre, and all extension dependencies installed.

## Versioning

The version of the Docker image can be configured in the `Cargo.toml` file in this directory. We may wrap Postgres in our Tembo distribution, but for the time being this crate is just a placeholder to allow for versioning.
